# Building Modern AI Agents with LLMs, RAG, and Knowledge Graphs

Welcome to the official repository for the book **"Building AI Agents with LLMs, RAG, and Knowledge Graphs"**.  
This hands-on guide teaches you how to design, build, and deploy powerful AI agents using modern tools such as Transformers, Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Knowledge Graphs.

## ðŸ“š Table of Contents (Chapters)

1. **How to Analyze Text Data with Deep Learning**  
   Learn the foundations of NLP and how deep learning models process and understand text.

2. **The Transformer: The Model Behind the Modern AI Revolution**  
   Understand how the Transformer architecture powers LLMs like GPT and BERT.

3. **The Engine Behind an AI Agent: Large Language Model**  
   Dive into LLMs and how they form the reasoning core of an autonomous agent.

4. **Building a Web Scraping Agent with an LLM**  
   Build agents that extract and structure web data using LLM-driven reasoning.

5. **Extend Your Agent with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
   Learn how to ground your AI agent in real data and reduce hallucinations using retrieval.

6. **Advanced RAG Techniques for Information Retrieval and Augmentation**  
   Go beyond basics: apply chunking, vector search, hybrid pipelines, and re-ranking.

7. **Create and Connect a Knowledge Graph to an AI Agent**  
   Make your agents smarter and more contextual through structured knowledge.

8. **Reinforcement Learning and AI Agents**  
   Introduce learning from feedback and build agents that optimize for outcomes.

9. **Creating Single and Multi-Agent Systems**  
   Architect collaborative and modular agents for scalable real-world tasks.

10. **Create Your AI Agent and Connect to Web API**  
    Let your agent talk to the real world: execute actions, retrieve data, interact.
